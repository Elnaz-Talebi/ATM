# ATM Machine Simulation

## Overview

üèß This project is a Python-based ATM machine simulation that allows users to perform basic banking operations such as checking their balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money. 

For sake of simplicity there is no database in this project. There is a static user with a ("username" : "user1" ), and a ("pin" : "1234" ), and an initial balance of 5000 to play around with.


## Features


- **ATM Functionalities**:
  - **Check Balance**: View the current balance of the user.
  - **Deposit Money**: Add money to the user's account.
  - **Withdraw Money**: Withdraw money from the user's account, with checks for sufficient funds.
  - **Exit**: Exit the ATM simulation.
- **User Authentication**: Users are required to enter a PIN number to access their account.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
